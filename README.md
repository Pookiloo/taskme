# Task Management and Tracking App

Welcome to the **Task.me** repository! This app is being developed using Flutter during my co-op semester, with the goal of creating an intuitive and efficient tool for managing and tracking tasks.

## Features (Planned)

- **Task Management**: Create, edit, and delete tasks.
- **Task Prioritization**: Assign priority levels to tasks.
- **Progress Tracking**: Track the status of tasks (e.g., To-Do, In Progress, Completed).
- **Reminders**: Set deadlines and reminders for tasks.
- **Time Efficiency Info**: Have a task timer to calculate you work efficiency.
- **Categorization**: Organize tasks by categories or projects.
- **Search and Filter**: Quickly find tasks using search and filter options.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Seamlessly works on Android, iOS, and web.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: For cross-platform app development.
- **Dart**: The programming language behind Flutter.
- **State Management**: TBD (e.g., Provider, Riverpod, or Bloc).
- **Database**: TBD (e.g., SQLite, Hive, or Firebase Firestore).
- **Notifications**: TBD (e.g., Firebase Cloud Messaging, local notifications).

## Project Goals

1. Build a user-friendly interface for task creation and management.
2. Ensure smooth performance and responsiveness across all platforms.
3. Learn and apply best practices in Flutter app development.
4. Implement features incrementally with regular testing and feedback.
